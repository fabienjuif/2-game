## ðŸ¤”  What is it?
This is a clone of [Antiyoy](https://github.com/yiotro/Antiyoy) which is a clone of [Slay](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/slay/9nnq0xvqwljg?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) with multiplayer support, written in JS.

## ðŸŽ®  Try it?!
Do you want to test the game online?
Ask me in issue or in twitter so I give you the link.

The link is not publicly available because I am not sure that I don't have leaks that could break the server.

## ðŸ¤– Hack it!
- `yarn` install dependencies
- `yarn start` start the development mode
  * you can go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) after all is started
  * listen for changes in all sources
- `yarn test` run tests, only the engine is tested right now
- `make [build]` build the application (production ready)
- `make start` run the production ready application locally
