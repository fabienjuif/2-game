# 2-game

Just for fun and to try react-pixi from inlet.

- beta1: https://fabienjuif.github.io/2-game/beta1/
  * Trying to see the limit of sprites that I can have (here 100 bunnys seems fine)
  * Trying some ease function
  * Moving taking `delta` and calculating frames so every devices will move at same speed (but some will have smooth animation, and others not)

- beta2: https://fabienjuif.github.io/2-game/beta2/
  * Trying to add tiles, and add a color transition for each
  * This works not that great, I have to batch modifications I guess

- beta3: https://fabienjuif.github.io/2-game/beta3/
  * beta2 optimisation

- beta4: https://fabienjuif.github.io/2-game/beta4/
  * camera
  * bunnies are behind the scene and not in the camera action
  * you can zoom in / zoom out
  * you can move the tiles
  * works on phone

- beta5: https://fabienjuif.github.io/2-game/beta5/
  * "next turn" button to trigger the next tiles turn
  * uses a service (React Context)
  * uses React DOM to build the UI
