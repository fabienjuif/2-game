# 2-game

Just for fun and to try react-pixi from inlet.

- beta1: https://fabienjuif.github.io/2-game/beta1/
  * Tring to see the limit of sprites that I can have (here 100 bunnys seems fine)
  * Trying some ease function
  * Moving taking `delta` and calculating frames so every devices will move at same speed (but some will have smooth animation, and others not)
